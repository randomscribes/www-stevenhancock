Hi, I'm Steven. That is all you really need to know until I have a chance to fill this out in more detail.

I'm a dad with two beautiful children and beautiful wife.

If you want to dig a little deeper, I'm a *data guy*. If you must label it, I'm an Analytics Data Scientist who ventures into inference and never really touches algorithms (I like [AirBnB's classifications of data scientists](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-data-science-job-doesnt-fit-all-elena-grewal/)).
