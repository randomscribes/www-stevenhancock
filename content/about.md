Hi, I'm Steven. That is all you really need to know until I have a chance to fill this out in more detail.

I'm a dad with two beautiful children and beautiful wife.

If you want to dig a little deeper, I'm a *data guy*. Maybe call me an Analytics Data Scientist who ventures into inference and rarely touches algorithms (I like [AirBnB's classifications of data scientists](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-data-science-job-doesnt-fit-all-elena-grewal/))? Probably the best label I've come across that describes what I've been doing is [Analytics Engineer](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/02/analytics-engineer-data-team.html). So if you must label me... I guess label me an Analytics Engineer, even if I have never offically held the title.
