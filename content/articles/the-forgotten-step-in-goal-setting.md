There’s a lot of goal setting frameworks out there. Between ORKs, SMART Goals, BHAGs, or even Goal Pyramids (like Rockefeller’s Strategic Planning Pyramid) you’ll choose some specific goals that are measurable, actionable, audacious (but achievable), and time limited. I’m not going to tell you how to set goals or even that you should set goals (there may be harmful effects). I will, however, tell you that unless you are willing to analyze the results don’t even waste your time setting goals.
